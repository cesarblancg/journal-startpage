![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

This browser extension provides a journal and todo apps in the startpage of your browser.

Inspired by [Elegant New Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elegant-startage-new-tab/)

## Roadmap

### Todo

- Reorder tasks
- Customize colors
- Search journal
- rework journal:
  - ~~limit to one entry per day ?~~ -> rather display time as well as date
  - allow to change date 
  - integrate with calendar
- double click to delete entry
- firefox sync
- select locale
- integrate calendar (to show upcoming events)

### Done

- improve calendar display
- handle multiple open tabs: data is not overriden

# Develop

Run:

- `pnpm start` to run in develop mode
- `pnpm build` to build the production assets
